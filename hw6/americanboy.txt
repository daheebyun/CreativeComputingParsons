Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy, American boy

He said Hey Sister
It's really really nice to meet ya
I just met this 5 foot 7 guys who's just my type
I like the way he's speaking his confidence is peaking
Don't like his baggy jeans but I'ma like what's underneath it
And no I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York heart awaits
First let's see the west end
I'll show you to my bredrins
I'm like this American boy, American boy

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy, American boy

Can we get away this weekend
Take me to Broadway
Let's go shopping baby then we'll go to a cafe
Let's go on the subway
Take me to your hood
I neva been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good
Dress in all your fancy clothes
Sneaker's looking Fresh to Def I'm lovin' those Shell Toes
Walkin' that walk
Talk that slick talk
I'm likin' this American Boy, American boy

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy, American boy

Would you be my love, my love
Could be mine would you be my love my love, could be mine
Could you be my love, my love
Would you be my American boy, American boy

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy, American boy
